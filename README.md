# Twitter_Sentiment_ByKeyWord

The main aim of the project is to analyse the overall reaction on top news that Twitter users are posting and to see the attitude of people using this social media towards one or another event/famous person/community/organization. Some tweets carry negative review on something happening in the world, and some tweets carry positive review. The important thing is to identify which tweets actually can make an impact by analyzing profiles of Twitter users, in particular, how popular are they, thus how popular their tweets can be and how they can form an attitude of Twitter users society towards one subject or another. The highlight was made on politics as Twitter is the leading social media platform for political campaigns. Candidates running for President, firtsly, in Ukraine in 2019, and latter in USA summer 2019 were taking into account. However, any key word can be analyzed in the same way.
